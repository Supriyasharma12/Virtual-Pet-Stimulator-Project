##  Game Logic

- Pet mood is calculated based on the three bars:
  - If hunger is too high, pet becomes sad or grumpy
  - If energy is low, pet becomes exhausted
  - If happiness drops, mood becomes sad or crying
- Temporary action image is shown when user performs an action (e.g. eating, sleeping), followed by mood image
